                            <p>Alpaca makes its services available to persons and businesses in countries where
                                it is not otherwise prohibited. Alpaca does not solicit any non-domestic persons or
                                businesses. If I am a non-domestic person or business, I must explicitly
                                acknowledge and confirm that I have not been solicited by Alpaca prior to
                                becoming a customer of Alpaca (a “Non-Domestic Customer”). To the extent that
                                I am a Non-Domestic Customer, I understand and acknowledge that Alpaca also
                                may conduct more extensive due diligence and require additional identity
                                documentation for Non-Domestic Customers. All Non-Domestic Customers must
                                complete and provide to Alpaca an appropriate Form W-8 and its certification. In
                                order for a Non-Domestic Customer to keep an account open, a Non-Domestic
                                Customer must keep an appropriate Form W-8 current and no less than every 36
                                months, re-certify that the information on the appropriate Form W-8 is correct and
                                accurate. I acknowledge and understand that any failure to satisfy the
                                aforementioned obligations may, at Alpaca’s sole discretion, result in the
                                restriction and/or termination of my account.</p>

                <p>I understand that all investments involve risk, that losses may exceed the principal
                    invested, and that the past performance of a security, industry, sector, market, or financial
                    product does not guarantee future results or returns.</p>

                <p>I understand that My Account comes with many defaulted service instruction features and
                    preferences. I further understand that I am not required to use these defaulted options or
                    preferences and that once My Account is approved and opened, I have the sole discretion
                    to control and adjust such defaulted service preferences that relate to my Account(s).</p>

                <p>I understand that I am solely responsible for knowing the rights and terms for all
                    securities purchased, sold and maintained in My Account, including, but not limited to,
                    mergers, reorganizations, stock splits, name changes and/or symbol changes, and
                    dividends. I further understand that certain securities may grant Me valuable rights that
                    may expire unless I take specific action. These securities include bonds, convertible
                    securities, warrants, stock rights and securities subject to exchange offers or tenders. I am
                    responsible for knowing all expiration dates, redemption dates, and the circumstances under which rights associated with My securities may be called, canceled, or modified.
                    You may, but are not obligated to, notify Me of any upcoming expiration or redemption
                    dates, or take any action on My behalf without My specific instructions except as
                    required by law and the rules of regulatory authorities.</p>

            <!-- Clause 9 -->
            <li>
                <h3>Purchases.</h3>
                <p>All orders for the purchase of securities given for My Account will be authorized by Me
                    and executed in reliance on My promise that an actual purchase is intended. It is My
                    obligation to pay for purchases immediately or on Alpaca’s demand. I understand Alpaca
                    may, at any time, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Me, prohibit or restrict
                    My ability to trade securities. I further agree not to allow any person to trade for My
                    Account unless a trading authorization for that person has been received and approved by
                    Alpaca. You reserve the right to require full payment in cleared funds prior to the
                    acceptance of any order. In the event that I fail to provide sufficient funds, You may, at
                    Your option and without notice to Me, i) charge a reasonable rate of interest, ii) liquidate
                    the Property subject of the buy order, or iii) sell other Property owned by Me and held in
                    any of My Accounts. You may also charge any consequential loss to My Account. For
                    purposes of this Agreement, “Property” shall mean all monies, contracts, and all related
                    distributions, proceeds, products and accessions. This includes all such Property held,
                    maintained or carried by Alpaca Securities LLC in any manner for Me.</p>

            <!-- Clause 10 -->
            <li>
                <h3>Sales/Short Sales.</h3>
                <p>I promise to deliver all securities sold in My Account. Alpaca requires that a security be
                    held in an account prior to the acceptance of a sell order with respect to such security
                    unless the order is specifically designated as a “short sale” and is permitted as described
                    below. If a security is not held in My Account and a sell order is processed, I must
                    promptly deliver such security to Alpaca for receipt in good deliverable form on or before
                    the settlement date. Any order accepted without negotiable certificates or positions in My
                    Account will be subject, at Alpaca’s sole discretion, to cancellation or buy-in. To ensure
                    this will not occur, I agree to only place sell orders for securities owned by Me and held
                    in My Account at the time My order is placed. Proceeds of a sale will not be paid to me
                    or released into My Account until Alpaca has received the security in good deliverable
                    form, whether from a transfer agent or from Me, and the settlement of the security is
                    complete. If the security is not received on or before the settlement date, or as market
                    conditions warrant, Alpaca may in its sole discretion purchase the security on the open
                    market for My Account and may liquidate and close out any and all securities in My
                    Account in order to pay for such purchase. In the event a security is bought in, I will be
                    responsible for all resulting Losses incurred by Alpaca.</p>
                <p>I understand that I may only place an order for a short sale which is specifically
                    designated as a “short sale”, if my Local Jurisdiction permits short sales and if the
                    arrangement through which I opened an account at Alpaca permits it. If permitted, I
                    promise to provide collateral of a type and amount acceptable to Alpaca for all short sales
                    in My Account. I understand that I may execute short sales only in a margin account (See
                    Appendix A, as applicable) and that such execution must comply with applicable short
                    sales rules.</p>

                <p>I understand that when I request assistance from Your employees in using the investment
                    tools available on the Website, the App, or API, it will be limited to an explanation of the
                    tool’s functionality and, if requested by Me, to the entry by Your employees of variables
                    provided by Me, and that such assistance does not constitute investment advice, an

                <h3>Local Jurisdiction.</h3>
                <p>I understand that applicable laws, rules and regulations vary from jurisdiction to
                    jurisdiction, and it is My responsibility to make sure that I comply with any and all local
                    regulations, directives, restrictions and laws in my jurisdiction of residence (“Local
                    Jurisdiction”) prior to entering into this Agreement. I have verified and determined that
                    entering into this Agreement and utilizing the services offered by Alpaca hereunder does
                    not violate any such laws, rules or regulations of my Local Jurisdiction applicable to Me.</p>

                    regulation, (ii) any rules or regulations of any self-regulatory organization of which

                <p>I understand that Alpaca may have, or in the future may make, arrangements with certain
                    third parties (“Third Parties”) to offer additional or supplemental services to me in
                    connection with or in addition to My Account (“Third Party Services”). These Third
                    Party Services are governed by the relevant documentation relating to such Third Party
                    Services (“Third Party Documentation”). In connection with entering into this Agreement
                    and Third Party Documentation, I understand that I am subject to certain limitations,
                    restrictions or prohibitions on My activity, including but not limited to activity with

                    any conflict with respect to this Agreement and any Third Party Documentation regarding Prohibited Activity, the document or agreement containing the most restrictive terms shall
                    prevail for purposes of this Agreement.</p>

                    such dividend/distribution to the entitled purchaser of the securities I sold, and I
                    guarantee to promptly reimburse You for, or deliver to You, said dividend or distribution.</p>

                <h3>Market Volatility; Market Orders; Limit Orders; and Queued Orders.</h3>
                <p>I understand that, whether I place a market or limit order, I will receive the price at which
                    my order is executed in the marketplace. Particularly during periods of high volume,
                    illiquidity, fast movement or volatility in the marketplace, the execution price received
                    may differ from the quote provided on entry of an order, and I may receive partial
                    executions of an order at different prices. I understand that Alpaca is not liable for any
                    price fluctuations. I also understand that price quotes generally are for only a small
                    number of shares as specified by the marketplace, and larger orders are relatively more
                    likely to receive executions at prices that vary from the quotes or in multiple lots at
                    different prices.</p>
                <p>I understand that securities may open for trading at prices substantially higher or lower
                    than the previous closing price or the anticipated price. If I place a market order (whether
                    during normal market hours or when the market is closed), I agree to pay or receive the
                    prevailing market price at the time My market order is executed, subject to the specific
                    clarification above relating to buy orders. I understand that the price I pay may be
                    significantly higher or lower than anticipated at the time I placed the order. To avoid
                    buying a security at a higher price and possibly exceeding My purchasing power, I
                    understand My option to enter a limit order. I also understand that limit orders may not be
                    executed at any particular time, or at all if there is not sufficient trading at or better than
                    the limit price I specify, and are only good until the end of the trading day in which they
                    are entered. The Website contains further information regarding order types and
                    limitations, which I agree to read and understand before placing such orders.</p>
                <p>As a customer of Alpaca, I understand that orders submitted after regular trading hours
                    that have not been elected to be eligible for execution during the extended hours trading
                    session will be queued and routed to a market maker the following morning prior to the
                    regular trading open. The order will then be eligible for execution during regular trading
                    hours. “Extended hours trading” means trading outside of “regular trading hours.”
                    Regular trading hours generally means the time between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern
                    Standard Time.</p>
                <p>I understand that my order may fail to be sent to the market due to unforeseen
                    circumstances or technical issues and that Alpaca is not liable in the event my order fails.</p>

                <h3>Bulletin Board/Pink Sheet Stocks.</h3>
                <p>Securities that trade over-the-counter through FINRA’s OTC Bulletin Board, the OTC
                    Markets Group, or otherwise (each, an “OTC Security” and collectively “OTC
                    Securities”) present particular trading risks, in part because they are relatively less liquid
                    and more volatile than actively traded securities listed on a major exchange. I understand
                    that OTC Securities may be subject to different trading rules and systems than other
                    securities and that I may encounter significant delays in executions, reports of executions
                    and updating of quotations in trading OTC Securities. Alpaca, in its sole discretion, may
                    require limit orders on certain OTC Securities transactions.</p>
                <p>I understand that Alpaca only supports the trading of listed stocks and that under certain
                    circumstances, a listed stock may be delisted and become an OTC Security. Alpaca does
                    not support OTC Securities. If I hold securities in my Account that become OTC
                    Securities, I understand that Alpaca may, at its sole discretion, liquidate the OTC
                    Securities and place the proceeds, if any, in My Account without prior notification to me.</p>

                <h3>Fractional Trades</h3>
                <p>Alpaca allows for the purchase of fractional shares. I acknowledge and understand that
                    You round all holdings of fractional shares to the ninth decimal place, the value of
                    fractional shares to the nearest cent, and any dividends paid on fractional shares to the
                    lower cent. I further understand that You may not accept dollar-based purchases or sales
                    of less than $1.00 and that I will receive proceeds from the sale of any whole or fractional
                    shares rounded to the nearest cent.</p>
                <p>I understand that if I enter repeated fractional orders with individual notional values of
                    less than $0.01, my account may be restricted.</p>
                <p>To the extent that You must purchase or sell shares in the market to fulfill any part of my
                    fractional order, the fractional component of that order will be fulfilled at the execution
                    price received for the corresponding whole shares. I understand that You fulfill my
                    fractional order for national exchange-listed securities (“NMS Securities”) entirely out of
                    Your inventory and without purchasing or selling shares in the market (“Inventory
                    Fulfillment”); you will endeavor to price such shares or fractional shares at a price between the National Best Bid and Offer (“NBBO”) at the time of the order for orders made during market hours. You will endeavor to price such orders between the best bid
                    and offer at the time of the order.</p>
                <p>I understand that fractional shares within My Account (i) are unrecognized,
                    unmarketable, and illiquid outside the Alpaca platform, (ii) are not transferrable in-kind,
                    and (iii) may only be liquidated and the proceeds transferred out via a wire transfer. I
                    acknowledge, that subject to applicable requirements, You may report holdings and
                    transactions in My Account in terms of either U.S. Dollars, shares, or both.</p>
                <p>I agree that my fractional shareholdings shall be treated as a “financial asset” under
                    Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>

                <p>The Margin Account and Trading appendix attached hereto as Appendix A sets forth the
                    terms and conditions for Me to open a margin account. Appendix A shall only apply to
                    this Agreement to the extent that Alpaca provides me notice of such, separately and in
                    writing. The margin account allows Me to trade using unsettled funds up to the amount in
                    My margin account if I am to receive margin credit. The margin account requires a
                    minimum deposit of $2,000 or 100 percent of the purchase price - whichever is less - in
                    the account before purchasing a security on margin. I acknowledge it is important that I
                    fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin as described in
                    Appendix A and the Margin Disclosure Statement.</p>

                    data. I understand that neither Alpaca nor any participating national securities exchange
                    or association nor any supplier of market data guarantees the timeliness, sequence,

                    accounts will be required to maintain $25,000 equity at all times in order to continue day
                    trading. I acknowledge it is important that I fully understand the risks involved in day

                    misconduct. In addition, I agree that You and Your affiliates and respective partners,
                    managing directors, officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, “Indemnified
                    Parties”) shall have no liability for, and I agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
                    Indemnified Parties from, all Losses that result from: (i) My or My agent’s
                    misrepresentation or alleged misrepresentation, or act or omission, (ii) Indemnified
                    Parties following My or My agent’s directions or failing to follow My or My agent’s
                    unlawful or unreasonable directions, (iii) any activities or services of the Indemnified

                    services, reporting, trading, research or capital introduction services), or (iv) the failure

                    obligations to Me.</p>
                <p>I consent to the use of automated systems or service bureaus by You and Your affiliates in

                    Automated Systems (collectively, a “System Failure”) that could cause substantial

                    have no liability whatsoever for any claim, loss, cost, expense, damage or liability of Me
                    arising out of or relating to a System Failure.</p>
                <p>I also agree that Indemnified Parties will have no responsibility or liability to Me in
                    connection with the performance or non-performance by any Exchange, clearing
                    organization, or other third party (including, without limitation, other clearing firms,
                    banks and International Executing Brokers as defined infra) or any of their respective
                    agents or affiliates, of its or their obligations relative to any Securities. I agree that
                    Indemnified Parties will have no liability, to Me or to third parties, or responsibility
                    whatsoever for: (i) any Losses resulting from a cause over which Indemnified Parties do
                    not have direct control, including but not limited to the failure of mechanical equipment,
                    unauthorized access, theft, operator errors, government restrictions, force majeure (as
                    defined in Section 28), Exchange rulings or suspension of trading; and (ii) any special,
                    indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages (including lost profits,
                    trading losses and damages) that I may incur in connection with My use of the brokerage
                    and other services provided by Indemnified Parties under this Agreement. Further, if I
                    authorize or allow third parties to gain access to Your services, including My Accounts, I
                    will defend and indemnify You against any Losses arising out of claims or suits by such
                    third parties based upon or relating to such access and use. Alpaca does not warrant
                    against loss of use or any direct, indirect or consequential damages or losses to Me caused by My assent, expressed or implied, to a third party accessing My Account or information, including access provided through any other third party systems or sites.</p>

                <h3>Mutual Fund Transactions.</h3>
                <p>In the event that I purchase or hold a mutual fund, I agree to read and understand the
                    terms of its prospectus. I understand that certain mutual funds reserve the right to change
                    their purchasing, switching or redemption procedures and/or suspend or postpone
                    redemptions under certain market conditions. I further understand that any mutual fund
                    order entered with You is placed by You on a best efforts basis as prescribed and
                    recognized by the individual fund, and that You are not responsible for unexecuted orders
                    due to the failure of any communication system. I agree to be fully responsible for the
                    information contained within the mutual fund prospectus and to hold You harmless for
                    any deficiencies contained therein. I authorize You to act as My agent in the purchase and
                    redemption of fund shares.</p>

                <h3>Exchange Traded Funds.</h3>
                <p>Investors should consider the investment objectives and unique risk profile of Exchange
                    Traded Funds (ETFs) carefully before investing. ETFs are subject to risks similar to those
                    of other diversified portfolios. Leveraged and Inverse ETFs may not be suitable for all
                    investors and may increase exposure to volatility through the use of leverage, short sales
                    of securities, derivatives and other complex investment strategies. Although ETFs are
                    designed to provide investment results that generally correspond to the performance of
                    their respective underlying indices, they may not be able to exactly replicate the
                    performance of the indices because of expenses and other factors. A prospectus contains
                    this and other information about the ETF and should be read carefully before investing.
                    Customers should obtain prospectuses from issuers and/or their third party agents who
                    distribute and make prospectuses available for review. ETFs are required to distribute
                    portfolio gains to shareholders at year end. These gains may be generated by portfolio
                    rebalancing or the need to meet diversification requirements. ETF trading will also
                    generate tax consequences. Additional regulatory guidance on Exchange Traded Products

                    any of My Accounts that have been subject to an attachment or sequestration in any legal
                    proceeding against Me, and You shall be under no obligation to contest the validity of any

                    the representative of My estate or the survivor or survivors shall immediately give You
                    written notice thereof, and You may, before or after receiving such notice, take such
                    proceedings, require such papers and inheritance or estate tax waivers, retain such portion
                    of and/or restrict transactions in the Account as You may deem advisable to protect You
                    against any tax, liability, penalty or loss under any present or future laws or otherwise.
                    Notwithstanding the above, in the event of My death or the death of one of the joint
                    account holders, all open orders shall be canceled, but You shall not be responsible for
                    any action taken on such orders prior to the actual receipt of notice of death. Further, You
                    may, in Your discretion, close out any or all of the Accounts without awaiting the
                    appointment of a personal representative for My estate and without demand upon or
                    notice to any such personal representative. The estate of any of the account holders who
                    have died shall be liable, and each survivor shall continue to be liable, jointly and
                    severally, to You for any net debit balance or loss in said account in any way resulting
                    from the completion of transactions initiated prior to the receipt by You of the written
                    notice of the death of the decedent or incurred in the liquidation of the Account or the
                    adjustment of the interests of the respective parties. Such notice shall not affect Your
                    rights under this Agreement to take any action that You could have taken if I had not died.</p>

                            on any Form W-9 that I have provided or will provide to You) is My correct
                            taxpayer identification number (or I am waiting for a number to be issued to Me),
                            and (2) I am not subject to backup withholding because: (a) I am exempt from
                            backup withholding, or (b) I have not been notified by the Internal Revenue
                            Service (IRS) that I am subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to
                            report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified Me that I am no longer
                            subject to backup withholding, and (3) I am a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person

                            all dividends, interest and gross proceeds paid to me. Backup withholding taxes
                            are sent to the IRS and cannot be refunded by Alpaca. I further understand that if I

                <h3>Equity Orders and Payment For Order Flow.</h3>
                <p>SEC rules require all registered broker-dealers to disclose their policies regarding any
                    “payment for order flow” arrangement in connection with the routing of customer orders.
                    “Payment for order flow” includes, among other things, any monetary payment, service,
                    property, or other benefit that results in remuneration, compensation, or consideration to a
                    broker-dealer from any broker-dealer in return for directing orders. You transmit
                    customer orders for execution to various exchanges or market centers based on a number
                    of factors. These include: the size of order, trading characteristics of the security,
                    favorable execution prices (including the opportunity for price improvement), access to
                    reliable market data, availability of efficient automated transaction processing and reduced execution costs through price concessions from the market centers. Certain of the market centers may execute orders at prices superior to the publicly quoted market in accordance with their rules or practices. While a customer may specify that an order be
                    directed to a particular market center for execution, the order-routing policies, taking into
                    consideration all of the factors listed above, are designed to result in favorable transaction
                    processing for customers. The nature and source of any payments and/or credits received
                    by You in connection with any specific transactions will be furnished upon written
                    request.</p>

                    necessary to satisfy any debts arising in any of My Accounts. I further understand that
                    Alpaca receives from its custodian banks and clearing relationships, interest and/or
                    rebates derived from customer margin debt balances and customer free credit balances.</p>

                    Agreement. Those charges are included in the Alpaca Fee Schedule. I also agree to pay
                    all applicable federal, state and local taxes. I authorize Alpaca to automatically debit My
                    Account for any such charges, fees and taxes. I acknowledge that the prevailing rate of
                    fees may change and that change may occur without notice. I agree to be bound by such
                    changes. I specifically agree to pay a reasonable rate of interest on the principal amount
                    of any debit balance carried with respect to My Account. Interest may be charged against
                    My Account in connection with cash withdrawals, if the proceeds from a security sale are
                    disbursed before the regular settlement date of the sale transaction and late payments. If
                    Alpaca receives My payment for securities purchases in a cash account after the
                    settlement date, I shall be charged a late payment fee plus a daily interest charge on the
                    debit balance until Alpaca is fully paid. Charges will be calculated using a prevailing
                    interest rate. The charges shall accrue until paid and posted to My Account on the day
                    following payment of the debit balance. Interest due on My Account is payable on
                    demand. I also agree to pay such expenses incurred by You in connection with the
                    collection of any unpaid balance due on My Accounts, including, but not limited to,
                    attorney’s fees allowed by law.</p>

                    electronic check process or Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) facility to draft funds in
                    the amount of any of My checks payable to Alpaca, its agents or assigns. Money
                    deposited via ACH is normally not available for withdrawal for 5 to 10 business days.</p>
                <p>Within 63 days of the date of My ACH deposit, My funds may only be withdrawn to the
                    bank account from which such funds were deposited. I understand that for the ACH
                    transfers to be established, at least one common name must match exactly between My
                    Alpaca and bank accounts. To send and receive ACHs, My bank must be a member of the
                    ACH system. For ACH transactions, I hereby grant You limited power of attorney for
                    purposes of redeeming any shares in My Account if the payment exceeds available free
                    credits and direct You to accept any orders to make payments to an authorized bank
                    account and to fulfill these orders through the redemption of shares in My Account if the
                    payment exceeds available free credits. In addition, if I or any joint account owner
                    decides to rescind an ACH transfer, I hereby direct and grant You power of attorney to

                   <li>
                        <p>This Agreement contains a pre-dispute arbitration clause. By signing an
                        arbitration agreement, the parties agree as follows.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>All parties to this Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other
                                in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by
                                the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party’s ability
                                to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and
                                other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court
                                proceedings.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award
                                unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has
                                been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 calendar days
                                prior to the first scheduled hearing date.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of
                                arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for
                                bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible
                                for arbitration may be brought to court.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any
                                amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this Agreement.</p></li>
                        </ol>

                   <li>
                       <p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
                            settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of FINRA Dispute
                            Resolution, Inc. (“FINRA DR”). I agree to arbitrate any controversy or claim
                            before FINRA DR in the State of California.</p>
                   </li>
                   <li><p>This agreement to arbitrate constitutes a waiver of the right to seek a judicial
                            forum unless such a waiver would be void under the federal securities laws.
                            If I am a foreign national, non-resident alien, or if I do not reside in the
                            United States, I agree to waive My right to file an action against You in any
                            foreign venue.</p></li>
                   <li><p>No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor
                        seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person
                        who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a
                        putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims
                        encompassed by the putative class action until:</p>

                            <li><p>the customer is excluded from the class by the court.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                   <li>Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a
                        waiver of any rights under this Agreement except to the extent stated herein.</li>

                            government, regulatory or self-regulatory agency or body, or are deemed invalid
                            or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provisions shall be
                            deemed rescinded or modified, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to make
                            this Agreement in compliance with such law, rule or regulation, or to be valid and
                            enforceable, but in all other respects, this Agreement shall continue in full force

                    or tax advice. An Alpaca account is not necessarily suitable for everyone. I agree to

                    whether the Alpaca account meets my investment needs.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline">Appendix A: Margin Account and Trading.</h2>
        <p>Margin trading involves interest charges and risks, including the potential to lose more than
            deposited or the need to deposit additional collateral in a falling market. Before using margin,
            customers must determine whether this type of trading strategy is right for them given their
            specific investment objectives, experience, risk tolerance, and financial situation. I understand
            that My Account with You will constitute a margin account and that by entering into this
            Agreement, I agree to each of the terms and provisions of this appendix.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Definitions. For the purposes of this appendix, “securities, commodities, and other property,”
                    shall include, but not be limited to, money, securities, and commodities of every kind and
                    nature and all contracts and options relating thereto, whether for present or future delivery.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lien. All of your securities, commodities, and other property, which Alpaca may at any time
                    be carrying, or which may at any time be in Alpaca’s possession or under Alpaca’s control,
                    shall be subject to a general lien and security interest in Alpaca’s favor for the discharge of all
                    of My indebtedness and other obligations to Alpaca, without regard to Alpaca having made
                    any advances in connection with such securities and other property and without regard to the
                    number of Accounts I may have with Alpaca. In enforcing its lien, Alpaca shall have the
                    discretion to determine which securities and property are to be sold and which contracts are
                    to be closed.</p></li>
            <li><p>Liquidation. If, in its discretion, Alpaca considers it necessary for protection to require
                    additional collateral, or in the event that a petition in bankruptcy is filed, or the appointment
                    of a receiver is filed by or against You, or an attachment is levied against Your Account(s), or
                    in the event of death (in case of partnerships), Alpaca shall have the right to sell any or all
                    securities, commodities, and other property in Your Account(s) with Alpaca, to buy any or all
                    securities, commodities, and other property which may be short in such accounts, to cancel
                    any open orders and to close any or all outstanding contracts, all without demand for margin
                    or additional margin, notice of sale or purchase, or other notice or advertisement. Any such
                    sales or purchases may be made at Alpaca’s discretion on any exchange or other market
                    where such business is usually transacted, or at public auction or private sale, and Alpaca
                    may be the purchaser for its own account. It is understood that a prior demand, or call, or
                    prior notice of the time and place of such sale or purchase shall not be considered a waiver of
                    Alpaca’s right to sell or buy without demand or notice.</p></li>
            <li><p>Payment of Indebtedness upon Demand and Liability for Costs of Collection. You shall at all
                    times be liable for the payment upon demand of any debit balance or other obligations owing
                    in any of Your Account(s) with Alpaca, and You shall be liable to Alpaca for any deficiency remaining in any such accounts in the event of the liquidation thereof, in whole or in part, by Alpaca or by You; and, You shall make payments of such obligations and indebtedness upon demand. The reasonable cost and expense of collection of the debit balance, recovery of
                    securities, and any unpaid deficiency in Your Account(s) with Alpaca, including, but not limited to attorney’s fees, incurred and payable or paid by Alpaca shall be payable to Alpaca by You.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pledge of Securities. All securities, commodities, and other property now or hereafter held,
                    carried, or maintained by Alpaca in its possession in any of Your Account(s) may be pledged
                    and re-pledged by Alpaca from time to time, without notice to You, either separately or in
                    common with other such securities, commodities, and other property for any amount due in
                    Your Account(s), or for any greater amount, and Alpaca may do so without retaining into its
                    possession or control for delivery, a like amount of similar securities, commodities, or other
                    property</p></li>
            <li><p>Margin Requirements, Credit Charges, and Credit Investigation. You will at all times
                    maintain such securities, commodities, and other property in Your Account(s) for margin
                    purposes as Alpaca shall require from time to time via a margin call or other request, and the
                    monthly debit balances or adjusted balances in Your Account(s) with Alpaca shall be charged,
                    in accordance with Alpaca practice, with interest at a rate permitted by laws of the State of
                    California. It is understood that the interest charge made to Your Account at the close of a
                    charge period will be added to the opening balance for the next charge period unless paid.
                    You acknowledge receipt of the Disclosure Statement, which explains the conditions under
                    which interest can be charged to Your Account, the annual rate of interest, how debit balances
                    are determined, and the methods of computing interest. You further acknowledge receipt of
                    the separate Margin Disclosure Statement, which provides some basic facts about purchasing
                    securities on margin and alerts you to the risks involved with trading securities in a margin
                    account. In regard to margin calls, whether for maintenance or any other margin call, in lieu
                    of immediate liquidations, Alpaca, may permit You a period of time to satisfy a call. This
                    time period shall not in any way waive or diminish Alpaca’s right in its sole discretion, to
                    shorten the time period in which You may satisfy the call, including one already outstanding,
                    or to demand that a call be satisfied immediately. Nor does such practice waive or diminish
                    the right of Alpaca to sell out positions to satisfy the call, which can be as high as the full
                    indebtedness owed by You. Margin requirements may be established and changed by Alpaca
                    in its sole discretion and judgment without notice to You. Alpaca may exchange credit
                    information about You with others. Alpaca may request a credit report on You, and upon
                    request, Alpaca will state the name and address of the consumer reporting agency that
                    furnished it. If Alpaca extends, updates, or renews Your credit, Alpaca may request a new
                    credit report without notifying You.</p></li>
            <li><p>Loan Consent. By signing this Agreement, You acknowledge that securities not fully paid for
                    by You may be loaned to Alpaca or loaned out to others at Alpaca’s sole discretion and
                    without prior notice to You.</p></li>
            <li><p>Shareholder Vote of Loaned Securities. In the event Your securities have been loaned by
                    Alpaca on the record date of a shareholder vote involving those securities, You agree that
                    Your vote may be reduced to reflect the total amount of Your securities loaned by Alpaca.</p></li>
